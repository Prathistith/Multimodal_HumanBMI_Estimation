# Integrating Multimodal Learning for Improved Vital Health Parameter Estimation

This paper introduces an innovative approach to estimating vital health parameters through multimodal learning, particularly in the context of malnutrition monitoring. By leveraging advanced techniques, the paper proposes a scalable system that can estimate critical health metrics using only a single full-body image.

## Abstract

Malnutrition poses a significant threat to global health, resulting from an inadequate intake of essential nutrients that adversely impacts vital organs and overall bodily functioning. Periodic examinations and mass screenings, incorporating both conventional and non-invasive techniques, have been employed to combat this challenge. However, these approaches suffer from critical limitations, such as the need for additional equipment, lack of comprehensive feature representation, absence of suitable health indicators, and the unavailability of smartphone implementations for precise estimations of Body Fat Percentage (BFP), Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), and Body Mass Index (BMI) to enable efficient smart-malnutrition monitoring. 

To address these constraints, this study presents a groundbreaking, scalable, and robust smart malnutrition-monitoring system that leverages a single full-body image of an individual to estimate height, weight, and other crucial health parameters within a multi-modal learning framework. Our proposed methodology involves the reconstruction of a highly precise 3D point cloud, from which 512-dimensional feature embeddings are extracted using a headless-3D classification network. Concurrently, facial and body embeddings are also extracted, and through the application of learnable parameters, these features are then utilized to estimate weight accurately. Furthermore, essential health metrics, including BMR, BFP, and BMI, are computed to comprehensively analyze the subject's health, subsequently facilitating the provision of personalized nutrition plans. While being robust to a wide range of lighting conditions across multiple devices, our model achieves a low Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of ± 4.7 cm and ± 5.3 kg in estimating height and weight.
